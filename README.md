# Introduction on IOT :-

Internet of Things (IoT) is an ecosystem of connected physical objects that are accessible through the internet. The ‘thing’ in IoT could be a person with a heart monitor or an automobile with built-in-sensors, i.e. objects that have been assigned an IP address and have the ability to collect and transfer data over a network without manual assistance or intervention. The embedded technology in the objects helps them to interact with internal states or the external environment, which in turn affects the decisions taken.

# This project covers :-
1. Home automation system using node mcu and sensors like DHT11(temperature sensor) and smoke sensor.
2. gsm based connection.
